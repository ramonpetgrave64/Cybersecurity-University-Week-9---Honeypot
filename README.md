# Cybersecurity-University-Week-9-Honeypot

We create a honeypot, using  Modern Honey Network (MHN).

- Which Honeypot(s) you deployed
- Issues:
  - For the assignment's instruction said to use ```github.com/RedolentSun/mhn.git```, but that repo is not available. I used the official repo instead: 
    ```github.com/threatstream/mhn.git```
- A summary of the data collected:
  - I used nmap on my local machine to scan for open ports. The MHN detected this. The honepot's exported data is in this repo.
- Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected
